Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game.<br/><br/>Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements.<br/><br/>You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here.<br/><br/>Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted.<br/><br/>Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. <br/><br/>While you can try, in most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. <br/><br/>You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel.<br/><br/>We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn’t your cup of tea, we don’t force you to deal with the depths of it. That being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances and fun."},{"__typename":"Description","type":"COMPATIBILITY_NOTICE","value":"1

Be sure to take proper care of her.<br/><br/>■The game features multiple endings!<br/>Your streamer will do things like become weird and emo for various reasons, subject her trusty P-chan to harm, and generally get messed up in the head.

These twists on familiar mechanics are often a product of the varied, increasingly dangerous environments that “El Hijo” must traverse to reach his ultimate goal.<br/><br/>- Survive the Wild West through the cleverness of a young hero<br/>- Explore dark monasteries, deserts and boomtowns in a spaghetti-western world<br/>- Merge with the shadows to hide from the lawless<br/>- Solve playfully tricky environmental puzzles<br/>- Use an arsenal of tactical toys to bypass and distract diverse desperadoes<br/>- Inspire other children to join you on the path to freedom<br/>- Enjoy the gripping storyline of a brave son searching for his mother"},{"__typename":"Description","type":"LEGAL","value":"© 2020 Honig Studios.

What kind of game is this?<br/>A. In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate.<br/>Pals can be used to fight and breed, or they can be made to work on farms or factories.<br/>You can even sell them or eat them.<br/><br/>▼Survival<br/>In a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.<br/><br/>▼Mounts & Exploration<br/>Pals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.<br/><br/>▼Building Structures<br/>Want to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. There are no labor laws for Pals, so exploit them to your heart's content.<br/><br/>▼Production<br/>Find a variety of useful Pals to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort.<br/><br/>▼Farming<br/>Some Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.<br/><br/>▼Factories & Automation<br/>Letting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed—until they're dead, that is.<br/><br/>▼Dungeon Exploration<br/>With Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life—even if it costs their own.<br/><br/>▼Breeding & Genetics<br/>Breed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all!<br/><br/>▼Poaching & Crime<br/>Endangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all.<br/><br/>▼Multiplayer<br/>Multiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too.<br/><br/>Collect all kinds of exciting Pals to fight, farm, build, and work for you in this completely new multiplayer, open world survival and crafting game!<br/><br/>*This title is a game that will receive regular updates based on user feedback in the future."},{"__typename":"Description","type":"COMPATIBILITY_NOTICE","value":"PS Plus required for online play<br/>Supports up to 4 online players with PS Plus<br/>Online play optional<br/>1 players<br/>PS5 Pro Enhanced"}],"id":"10011027","invariantName":"Palworld","media":[{"__typename":"Media","media":[{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":null,"type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/img/rnd/202410/0803/198b95f2029f3ee61054618d52bcde7d03906024fce44749.png"}],"role":"PREVIEW","type":"VIDEO","url":"https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202410/0801/1b584ef735b4a41955f04698f1048d6df1aa1c1d18e85560.mp4"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"FOUR_BY_THREE_BANNER","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2108/88c0126e1d3572f919b9d240ca7cf0eacf2d6212a2e83641.png"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"GAMEHUB_COVER_ART","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2108/d976f5d6313a7174e5341d3a5e3f21559f56f86f40a71d2f.png"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"LOGO","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202409/0401/f8bde4189cdf0eb2bc974da2de8c753ebc20adbedf05fe01.png"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"PORTRAIT_BANNER","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2108/0c2c5dd3020fb031106fc594da7fd83ad37af1921d2bd5bd.png"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"SCREENSHOT","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2108/34e09dfe8075244df27bf92e458a2df14b5bafbb460b4f9a.jpg"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"SCREENSHOT","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2108/b30aaafdef29465f3025be72e05bbb3203a6542aafc30442.jpg"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"SCREENSHOT","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2108/b159c6ac9b90627a7617ec7df5e41f67bb40909940f97272.jpg"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"SCREENSHOT","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2108/b6a44c1f275377f3e1f2d304a8599114e590b31cc4c181b2.jpg"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"SCREENSHOT","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2108/b6d6185120240db5b4f58bef3ce0931aea7c0b89fbfbd03b.jpg"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"SCREENSHOT","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2108/64de94483cfac5de0a430e7a785508b078dc77dde35425c9.jpg"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"SCREENSHOT","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2108/ad00a9fa5ffc6c2a616de6c740242b0f137c342d784ac7f6.jpg"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"SCREENSHOT","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202408/1501/32bf00f0dccb5749ec53e1bf8c3bde79bd0af44371ef31f0.jpg"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"SCREENSHOT","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202408/1501/1e28fcdb2513c734b58d14fb1ecd9c7b5ecd2fddad700f81.jpg"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"SCREENSHOT","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202408/1501/d1079dd43aae6c234a19875f973f93fb39a1e929d5305e50.jpg"},{"__typename":"Media","media":null,"role":"MASTER","type":"IMAGE","url":"https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202405/2108/a9c0fb99b704bfd04e85512a280acaf9a19901c8548b6792.png"}],"name":"Palworld","privacyPolicy":null,"publisherName":"Pocketpair","releaseDate":{"__typename":"ReleaseDate","type":"DAY_MONTH_YEAR","value":"2024-09-24T23:00:00Z"},"products":null},{"__typename":"Concept","combinedLocalizedGenres":[{"__typename":"LocalizedGenreSubGenre","value":"Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game"}],"compatibilityNotices":[{"__typename":"CompatibilityNotice","type":"NO_OF_PLAYERS","value":"1"},{"__typename":"CompatibilityNotice","type":"NO_OF_NETWORK_PLAYERS_PS_PLUS","value":"99"},{"__typename":"CompatibilityNotice","type":"PS4_ENHANCED","value":"true"},{"__typename":"CompatibilityNotice","type":"ONLINE_PLAY_MODE","value":"REQUIRED"},{"__typename":"CompatibilityNotice","type":"IN_GAME_PURCHASES","value":"OPTIONAL"},{"__typename":"CompatibilityNotice","type":"PS_PLUS_REQUIRED","value":"true"}],"descriptions":[{"__typename":"Description","type":"SHORT","value":"Dinosaurs thrive to survive in your Jurassic MMO sandbox adventures."},{"__typename":"Description","type":"LONG","value":"You've never experienced a dinosaur adventure like this before!
